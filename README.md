## User Story

As a person who loves burgers and wants to input names of burgers they would like to eat,
I want to be able to submit a burger name, see the burger name displayed in the waiting area and click a button,
So that once each burger has been Devoured by a click the burger will move to the other side of the page,
AND every burger will be stored in a database, whether devoured or not.


## Description

* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
* Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
* Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
* [Check out this video of the app for a run-through of how it works](https://youtu.be/msvdn95x9OM).

## Overview

* Create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Minimum Requirements

* Attempt to complete homework assignment as described in instructions. If unable to complete certain portions, please pseudocode these portions to describe what remains to be completed. Hosting on Heroku and adding a README.md are required for this homework.
